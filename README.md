The program finds one of the (possibly many) shortest paths between pairs of actors using graph Graph holding movies and actors as vertices, relationships as edges. All are simply strings.
Read input file and turn it into a Graph.

Generates a bipartite graph in which BOTH movies and actors are vertices. A graph in which all vertices are actors and movies are edges would be bad  This function also sets up the "actor" and "target" globals that will be used to direct the search crew is not of concern because it should be the co-stardom network.


In order to run the program, first, access to simple json jar file is needed. Then, run the driver file which CS245A2.java
